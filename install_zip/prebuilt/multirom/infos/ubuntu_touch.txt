# This file contains info about ROMs capabilites and boot process.
# It should be placed in ROM's folder (eg. /media/multirom/roms/*rom_name*)
# and must be named "rom_info.txt".
# Make sure you got the syntax correct, as the parser is probably pretty
# dumb. Lines with comments must start with #. Beware the whitespaces.
# If you need to use " character in string, just use it, no need to escape it
# MultiROM searches for first and last " on the line.
# These comments should not be deleted.

# So far, the only supported ROM type for these files is kexec-based linux
type="kexec"

# Paths to root of the ROM.
# Both image and folder can be specified at one time, MultiROM will use 
# the one which it can find. If both are present, folder is used.
# Must _not_ contain spaces.
# Path is from root of the root partition, but you will usually want
# to use following alias:
# - %m - ROM's folder (eg. /media/multirom/roms/*rom_name*)
root_dir="%m"
root_img="%m/data.img"
root_img_fs="ext4"

# Path to kernel and initrd. Kernel path _must_ be specified.
# Paths are relative to the folder in which is this file
# Those can be outside the root folder/image, or use %r if it is in there:
# kernel_path="%r/boot/vmlinuz"
# If ROM is in images, it will mount the image and load it from there.
# You can use  * _at the end of the filename_ as wildcard character.
kernel_path="zImage"
initrd_path="initrd.img"

# Set up the cmdline
# img_cmdline and dir_cmdline are appended to base_cmdline.
# Several aliases are used:
#  - %b - base command line from bootloader. You want this as first thing in cmdline.
#  - %d - root device. is either "UUID=..." (USB drive) or "/dev/mmcblk0p9" or "/dev/mmcblk0p10"
#  - %r - root fs type
#  - %s - root directory, from root of the root device
#  - %i - root image, from root of the root device
#  - %f - fs of the root image
base_cmdline="%b console=tty1 root=%d rootfstype=%r rw rootflags=defaults,noatime,nodiratime"
img_cmdline="loop=%s loopfstype=%f"
dir_cmdline="rootsubdir=%s"
