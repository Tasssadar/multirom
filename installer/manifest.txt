# This file contains info for recovery installation process
# Should be placed in root of installation zip file and must be
# named "manifest.txt".
# Make sure you got the syntax correct, as the parser is probably pretty
# dumb. Lines with comments must start with #. Beware the whitespaces.
# If you need to use " character in string, just use it, no need to escape it
# MultiROM searches for first and last " on the line.
# These comments should not be deleted.

# Manifest version
manifest_ver="1"

# Min MultiROM version
min_mrom_ver="5"

# Supported devices codenames. These are checked against
# ro.product.device property

# ROM name. If not specified, name of the installation file is used,
# which is recommmended. Don't use spaces.

# Installation text, it is displayed in recovery during installation.
# Use \n to make newlines

# Available install locations, "1" means it can be installed to that location
# You usually want all of these
# loc_internal - Internal memory
# loc_usb_dir - USB drive with extX filesystem
# loc_usb_img - USB drive with FAT32/NTFS filesystem, so ext4 images are used

# ROM base folders - the ones in root of ROM folder.
# There can only be maximum of 5 base folders!
# If USB drive w/ FAT32/NTFS image is used, each of these is separate image.
# If this is a Linux ROM, you usually want just "root". If it is Android-based,
# you probably want "cache", "system" and "data"
# Specify also min and default size of the image craeted for FAT32/NTFS drives
# in megabytes. Min value is used to check free space if it is not installed
# to image.
