# Make sure you got the syntax correct, as the parser is probably pretty

# If you need to use " character in string, just use it, no need to escape it
# MultiROM searches for first and last " on the line.
# These comments should not be deleted.

# ROM base folders - the ones in root of ROM folder.
# There can only be maximum of 5 base folders!
# If USB drive with filesystem for images is used, each of these is ext4 image
# If this is a Linux ROM, you usually want just "root". If it is Android-based,
# you probably want "cache", "system" and "data"
# Specify also min and default size of the image created for USB drives
# in megabytes. Min value is used to check free space if it is not installed
# to image.
